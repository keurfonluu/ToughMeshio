Installation
============

**toughio** only requires a Python distribution to be installed. If you don't have any yet, we recommend to install the `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ with the default options.

To install **toughio** and enable all its features, simply run the command in a terminal (e.g., Windows Terminal, Anaconda Prompt) or within an IPython shell:

.. code-block::

    pip install toughio[full]

An IDE such as Spyder (automatically installed by Anaconda) or `VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ is strongly recommended to use **toughio**.
