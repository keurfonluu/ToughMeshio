Preparation of Input Data
=========================

To characterize a flow system, users need to prepare input data, including hydrogeologic and thermal parameters and constitutive relations of the permeable medium (absolute and relative permeability, porosity, capillary pressure, heat conductivity, etc.), thermophysical properties of the 
fluids (mostly provided internally), initial and boundary conditions of the flow system, and sinks and sources.
In addition, TOUGH3 requires specification of space-discretized geometry, and various program options, computational parameters, and time-stepping information.
Here we summarize the basic conventions adopted for TOUGH3 input data (Section :ref:`tough3_input_data`), and provide a detailed explanation of input data formats (Section :ref:`tough3_input_format`); the summary and input formats for internal grid generation through the MESHMaker module are explained in Sections :ref:`geometry_data` and :ref:`input_formats_for_meshmaker`, respectively.
Some of the EOS modules have specialized input requirements (discussed in the addenda for those modules).
The TMVOC, ECO2N, and ECO2M modules have special options and input requirements, which are explained in separate reports (TMVOC: Pruess and Battistelli, 2002; ECO2N: Pruess, 2005, Pan et al., 2015; ECO2M: Pruess, 2013).


.. _tough3_input_data:

TOUGH3 Input Data
-----------------

Input can be provided to TOUGH3 in a flexible manner by means of one or several ASCII data files.
All TOUGH3 input is in fixed format (a few exceptions, such as data blocks **GENER** and **TIMBC**) and standard metric (SI) units, such as meters, seconds, kilograms, ËšC, and the corresponding derived units, such as Newtons, Joules, and Pascal = N/m\ :sup:`2` for pressure.

In the standard TOUGH3 input file data are organized in blocks which are defined by five-character keywords typed in columns 1-5; see :numref:`tab:3`.
The first record must be a problem title of up to 80 characters.
The last record usually is ENDCY; alternatively, ENDFI may be used if no flow simulation is to be carried out (useful for mesh generation).
Data records beyond **ENDCY** (or **ENDFI**) will be ignored.
Some data blocks, such as those specifying reservoir domains (ROCKS), volume elements (**ELEME**), connections (**CONNE**), sinks/sources (**GENER**), and initial conditions (**INDOM** and **INCON**), have a variable number of records, while others have a fixed number of records.
The end of variable-length data blocks is indicated by a blank record.
The data blocks can be provided in arbitrary order; exceptions are (1) the first line must be the title line, (2) **ELEME**, if present, must precede **CONNE**, (3) **START**, if present, must be specified before **INCON**, and (4) **MULTI** must be specified before **PARAM**, **INDOM**, **INCON** (only if :math:`NKIN \ne NK`), and **OUTPU**.
The blocks **ELEME** and **CONNE** must either be both provided through the input file, or must both be absent, in which case alternative means for specifying geometry data will be employed (see Section :ref:`geometry_data`).
If **START** is present, the block **INCON** can be incomplete, with elements in arbitrary order, or can be absent altogether.
Elements for which no initial conditions are specified in **INCON** will then be assigned domain-specific initial conditions from block **INDOM**, if present, or will be assigned default initial conditions given in block **PARAM**, along with default porosities given in **ROCKS**.
If **START** is not present, **INCON** must contain information for all elements, in exactly the same order as they are listed in block **ELEME** (note that initial conditions will be assigned to elements according to their order, not the element name).

.. note::

    \* These blocks can be provided on separate disk files, in which case they would be omitted from the *INPUT* file.

Between data blocks, an arbitrary number of records with arbitrary data may be present that do not begin with any of the TOUGH3 keywords.
This is useful for inserting comments about problem specifications directly into the input file.
TOUGH3 will gather all these comments and will print the first 50 such records in the output file.

Much of the data handling in TOUGH3 is accomplished by means of disk files, which are written in a format of 80 characters per record, so that they can be edited and modified with any text editor.

:numref:`tab:4` summarizes the disk files other than (default) INPUT and OUTPUT used in TOUGH3.
The initialization of the arrays for geometry, generation, and initial condition data is always made from the disk files *MESH* (or *MINC*), *GENER*, and *INCON*.
A user can either provide these files at execution time, or they can be written from TOUGH3 input data during the initialization phase of the program.
During this initialization phase, two binary files *MESHA* and *MESHB* are created from the disk file *MESH*.
If *MESHA* and *MESHB* exist in the working folder, the code will ignore the *MESH* file and the **ELEME** and **CONNE** blocks in the input file, and read geometric information directly from these two files, which will reduce the memory requirement for the master processor and enhance I/O efficiency.
If the mesh is changed, *MESHA* and *MESHB* must be deleted from the working folder to make the changes take effect.
If no data blocks **GENER** and **INCON** are provided in the input file, and if no disk files *GENER* and *INCON* are present, defaults will take effect (no generation; domain-specific initial conditions from block **INDOM**, or defaults from block **PARAM**). 
If a user intends to use these defaults, the user has to make sure that at execution time no disk files *INCON* or *GENER* are present from a previous run (or perhaps from a different problem).
A safe way to use default **GENER** and **INCON** is to specify "dummy" data blocks in the input file, consisting of one record with **GENER** or **INCON**, followed by a blank record. 

The format of data blocks **ELEME**, **CONNE**, **GENER**, and **INCON** is basically the same when these data are provided as disk files as when they are given as part of the input file.
However, specification of these data through the input file rather than as disk files offers some added conveniences, which are useful when a new simulation problem is initiated.
For example, a sequence of identical items (volume elements, connections, sinks or sources) can be specified through a single data record.
Also, indices used internally for cross-referencing elements, connections, and sources will be generated internally by TOUGH3 rather than having them provided by the user.
*MESH*, *GENER*, and *INCON* disk files written by TOUGH3 can be merged into an input file without changes, keeping the cross-referencing information.

TOUGH3 Input Format
-------------------

Here we cover the common input data for all EOS modules of TOUGH3.
Additional EOS-specific input data are discussed in the addendum for each EOS module.
The format described is for the default five-character element names.


TITLE
*****

This is the first record of the input file, containing a header of up to 80 characters, to be printed on output.
This can be used to identify a problem. If no title is desired, leave this record blank.


ROCKS
*****

Introduces material parameters for different reservoir domains.

.. list-table:: Record **ROCKS.1**.
    :name: tab:rocks.1
    :widths: 1 1 6
    :header-rows: 1
    :align: center

    *   - Parameter
        - Format
        - Description
    *   - ``MAT``
        - A5
        - material name (rock type).
    *   - ``NAD``
        - I5
        - | if zero or negative, defaults will take effect for a number of parameters (see below):
          | â‰¥ 1: will read another data record to override defaults.
          | â‰¥ 2: will read two more records with domain-specific parameters for relative permeability and capillary pressure functions.
    *   - ``DROK``
        - E10.4
        - rock grain density (kg/m\ :sup:`3``). If ``DROK`` is set to a very large value (typically 1.0E50), a constant temperature boundary condition can be specified (but variable pressure/saturation).
    *   - ``POR``
        - E10.4
        - default porosity (void fraction) for all elements belonging to domain ``MAT`` for which no other porosity has been specified in block **INCON**. Option **START** is necessary for using default porosity.
    *   - ``PER(I)``
        - E10.4
        - ``I`` = 1, 3 absolute permeabilities along the three principal axes, as specified by ``ISOT`` in block **CONNE**.
    *   - ``CWET``
        - E10.4
        - formation heat conductivity under fully liquid-saturated conditions (W/m ËšC).
    *   - ``SPHT``
        - E10.4
        - rock grain specific heat (J/kg ËšC). Domains with ``SPHT`` > 10\ :sup:`4` J/kg ËšC will not be included in global material balances. This provision is useful for boundary nodes, which are given very large volumes so that their thermo-dynamic state remains constant. Because of the large volume, inclusion of such nodes in global material balances would make the balances useless. 

When a (dummy) domain named "``SEED``" is specified, the absolute permeabilities specified in ``PER(I)`` are modified by the block-by-block permeability modifiers (PM) according to:

.. math::
    :label: eq:48

    k_n \rightarrow k_n^{'} = k_n \cdot \zeta_n

Here, :math:`k_n` is the absolute ("reference") permeability of grid block :math:`n`, as specified in data block **ROCKS** for the domain to which that grid block belongs, :math:`k_n^{'}` is the modified permeability, and :math:`\zeta_n` is the PM coefficient.
When PM is in effect, the strength of capillary pressure will be automatically scaled according to (:cite:label:`leverett1941capillary`)

.. math::
    :label: eq:49

    P_{cap, n} \rightarrow P_{cap, n}^{'} = \frac{P_{cap, n}}{\sqrt{\zeta_n}}

No grid blocks should be assigned to this domain; the presence of domain "``SEED``" simply serves as a flag to put permeability modification into effect.
Random (spatially uncorrelated) PM data can be internally generated in TOUGH3. Alternatively, externally defined permeability modifiers may be provided as part of the geometry data (PMX) in block **ELEME**. Available PM options are:

1. Externally supplied: :math:`\zeta_n = PMX - PER(2)`
2. "Linear": :math:`\zeta_n = PER(1) \times s - PER(2)`
3. "Logarithmic": :math:`\zeta_n = \exp \left( - PER(1) \times s \right) - PER(2)`

where :math:`s` is a random number between 0 and 1.

Data provided in domain "``SEED``" are used to select the following options.

.. list-table:: Domain "``SEED``".

        - | random number seed for internal generation of "linear" permeability modifiers:
          | = 0: (default) no internal generation of "linear" permeability modifiers.
          | > 0: perform "linear" permeability modification; random modifiers are generated internally with ``DROK`` as seed.
    *   - ``POR``
        - E10.4
        - | random number seed for internal generation of "logarithmic" permeability modifiers:
          | = 0:  (default) no internal generation of "logarithmic" permeability modifiers. 
          | > 0: perform "logarithmic" permeability modification; random modifiers are generated internally with ``POR`` as seed.
    *   - ``PER(1)``
        - E10.4
        - | scale factor (optional) for internally generated permeability modifiers:
          | = 0: (defaults to ``PER(1)`` = 1): permeability modifiers are generated as random numbers in the interval (0, 1).
          | > 0: permeability modifiers are generated as random numbers in the interval (0, ``PER(1)``).
    *   - ``PER(2)``
        - E10.4
        - | shift (optional) for internal or external permeability modifiers:
          | = 0: (default) no shift is applied to permeability modifiers.
          | > 0: permeability modifiers are shifted according to :math:`\zeta_n^{'} = \zeta_n - PER(2)`. All :math:`\zeta_n^{'} \lt 0` are set equal to zero.

If both ``DROK`` and ``POR`` are specified as non-zero, ``DROK`` takes precedence.
And if both ``DROK`` and ``POR`` are zero, permeability modifiers as supplied through **ELEME** data will be used.
Note that the domain "``SEED``" is not required in TOUGH3 if externally defined permeability modifiers in block **ELEME** are used without any shift.

MULTI
*****

Permits the user to select the number and nature of balance equations that will be solved.
For most EOS modules this data block is not needed, as default values are provided internally.
Available parameter choices are different for different EOS modules (see the addendum of the EOS module of interest).

.. list-table:: Record **MULTI.1**.
    :name: tab:multi.1
    :widths: 1 1 6

    *   - Parameter
        - Format
        - Description
    *   - ``NK``
        - I5
        - number of mass components.
    *   - ``NEQ``
        - I5
        - number of balance equations per grid block. Usually we have ``NEQ`` = ``NK`` + 1, for solving ``NK`` mass and one energy balance equation. Some EOS modules allow the option ``NEQ`` = ``NK``, in which case only ``NK`` mass balances and no energy equation will be solved.
    *   - ``NPH``
        - I5
        - number of phases that can be present (2 for most EOS modules).
    *   - ``NB``
        - I5
        - number of secondary parameters in the PAR-array other than component mass fractions. Available options include ``NB`` = 6 (no diffusion) and ``NB`` = 8 (include diffusion).
    *   - ``NKIN``
        - I5
        - number of mass components in **INCON** data (default is ``NKIN`` = ``NK``). This parameter can be used, for example, to initialize an EOS7R simulation (``NK`` = 4 or 5) from data generated by EOS7 (``NK`` = 2 or 3). If a value other than the default is to be used, then data block **MULTI** must appear before any initial conditions in data blocks **PARAM**, **INDOM**, or **INCON**.


START (optional)
****************

A record with **START** typed in columns 1-5 allows a more flexible initialization.
More specifically, when **START** is present, **INCON** data can be in arbitrary order, and need not be present for all grid blocks (in which case defaults will be used).
Without **START**, there must be a one-to-one correspondence between the data in blocks **ELEME** and **INCON**.


PARAM

    *   - ``KDATA``
        - I2
        - | specifies amount of printout (default is 1):
          | 0 or 1: print a selection of element variables.
          | 2: in addition, print a selection of connection variables.
          | 3: in addition, print a selection of generation variables.
          | If the above values for ``KDATA`` are increased by 10, printout will occur after each Newton-Raphson iteration (not just after convergence).
          | If negative values are used, printout for the selection of variables will be generated in the file format of TECPLOT. The amount of printout is given by the absolute value of ``KDATA``. 
    *   - ``MCYC``
        - I4
        - maximum number of time steps to be calculated. If a negative value is used, ``MCYC`` = 2\ :sup:`-MCYC`.
    *   - ``MSEC``
        - I4
        - maximum duration, in CPU seconds, of the simulation (default is infinite).
    *   - ``MCYPR``
        - I4
        - printout will occur for every multiple of ``MCYPR`` steps (default is 1). If a negative value is used, ``MCYPR`` = 2\ :sup:`-MCYPR`.
    *   - ``MOP(I)``
        - I1
        - ``I`` = 1, 24 allows choice of various options, which are documented in printed output from a TOUGH3 run. 
    *   - ``MOP(1)``
        - I1
        - if unequal 0, a short printout for non-convergent iterations will be generated.
    *   - | ``MOP(2)``
          | ...
          | ``MOP(6)``
        - I1
        - generate additional printout in various sub-routines, if set unequal 0. This feature should not be needed in normal applications, but it will be convenient when a user suspects a bug and wishes to examine the inner workings of the code. The amount of printout increases with ``MOP(I)`` (consult source code listings for details).
    *  - ``MOP(2)``
       - I1

         | 2: linear heat exchange *between a reservoir and confining beds* is on. Initial temperature for the confining bed adjacent to an element that has a non-zero heat transfer area is taken as the temperature of that element in data block **INCON**.
         | Heat capacity and conductivity of the confining beds are specified in block **ROCKS** for the particular domain to which the very last volume element in data block **ELEME** belongs. Thus, if a semi-analytical heat exchange calculation is desired, the user would append an additional dummy element of a very large volume at the end of the **ELEME** block, and provide the desired parameters as initial conditions and domain data, respectively, for this element. It is necessary to specify which elements have an interface area with the confining beds, and to give the magnitude of this interface area. This information is input as parameter ``AHTX`` in columns 31-40 of volume element data in block **ELEME**.

Depth-dependent well and formation properties (depth, radius, temperature, conductivity, density, capacity) are provided on an external file named *radqloss.dat* with the information in the following format: on the first line, ``NMATQLOSS`` is the number of elevations with geometric and thermal data, and ``NMATQLOSS`` lines are provided with the following data in free format: elevation [m], well radius [m], initial temperature [ËšC], ``CWET``, ``DROK``, ``SPHT``. Between elevations, properties are calculated using linear interpolation.
         | RESTART is possible for linear heat exchange between a reservoir and confining beds (``MOP(15)`` = 1 or 2), but not for radial heat exchange (``MOP(15)`` = 5 or 6). The data necessary for continuing the linear heat exchange calculation in a TOUGH3 continuation run are written onto a disk file *TABLE*. When restarting a problem, this file has to be provided under the name *TABLE*. If file *TABLE* is absent, TOUGH3 assumes that no prior heat exchange with confining beds has taken place.

ELEME
*****

Introduces element (grid block) information.

.. list-table:: Record **ELEME.1**.
    :name: tab:eleme.1

    *   - Parameter
        - Format
        - Description
    *   - ``EL``, ``NE``
        - A3, I2
        - five-character code name of an element. The first three characters are arbitrary, the last two characters must be numbers.
    *   - ``NSEQ``
        - I5
        - number of additional elements having the same volume and belonging to the same reservoir domain.
    *   - ``NADD``
        - I5
        - increment between the code numbers of two successive elements. (Note: the maximum permissible code number ``NE`` + ``NSEQ`` Ã— ``NADD`` is â‰¤ 99).
    *   - ``MA1``, ``MA2``
        - A3, A2
        - a five-character material identifier corresponding to one of the reservoir domains as specified in block **ROCKS**. If the first three characters are blanks and the last two characters are numbers then they indicate the sequence number of the domain as entered in **ROCKS**. If both ``MA1`` and ``MA2`` are left blank the element is by default assigned to the first domain in block **ROCKS**.
    *   - ``VOLX``
        - E10.4
        - element volume (m\ :sup:`3``).
    *   - ``AHTX``
        - E10.4
        - interface area (m\ :sup:`2`) for linear heat exchange with semi-infinite confining beds. Internal MESH generation via MESHMaker will automatically assign ``AHTX``.
    *   - ``PMX``
        - E10.4
        - | block-by-block permeability modification coefficient, :math:`\zeta_n` (optional). The ``PMX`` may be used to specify spatially correlated heterogeneous fields. But users need to run their own geostatistical program to generate the fields they desire, and then use preprocessing programs to place the modification coefficients into the **ELEME** data block, as TOUGH3 provides no internal capabilities for generating such fields.
          | If a dummy domain "``SEED``" is specified in data block **ROCKS**, it will be used as multiplicative factor for all the permeability parameters from block ROCKS (see Eq. :math:numref:`eq:48`), and strength of capillary pressure will be scaled according to Eq. :math:numref:`eq:49`. With a dummy domain "``SEED``" in data block **ROCKS**, ``PMX`` = 0 will result in an impermeable block.
          | In TOUGH3, ``PMX`` can be active without a dummy domain "``SEED``" in the ROCKS block. If a dummy domain "``SEED``" is not specified in data block **ROCKS**, it can be used to specify grid block permeabilities or permeability modifiers. If a positive value less than 10\ :sup:`-4` is given, it is interpreted as absolute permeability; if a negative value is provided, it is interpreted as a permeability modifier, i.e., a factor with which the absolute permeability specified in block **ROCKS** is multiplied. Alternatively, the same information can be provided through ``USRX`` (columns 31-40) in block **INCON**.
          | If ``PMX`` is blank for the first element, the element-by-element permeabilities are ignored. If a dummy domain "``SEED``" is not specified in data block **ROCKS**, strength of capillary pressure will not be automatically scaled. Leverett scaling of capillary pressure can be applied with ``MOP2(6)`` > 0 in data block **MOMOP**.
    *   - ``X``, ``Y``, ``Z``
        - 3E10.4
        - Cartesian coordinates of grid block centers. These may be included in the **ELEME** data to make subsequent plotting of results more convenient. Note that coordinates are not used in TOUGH3; the exceptions are for optional initialization of a gravity-capillary equilibrium with EOS9 and for optional addition of potential energy to enthalpy with ``MOP2(12)`` > 0 in data block **MOMOP**.
    *   - ``USERX(I)``
        - E10.4
        - anisotropic permeability or permeability modifier of the X-, Y-, and Z-direction for ``I`` = 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Based on the values, TOUGH3 will internally determine whether it is permeability itself or permeability modifier. To read three permeabilities or permeability modifiers, ``MOP2(20)`` in data block **MOMOP** should be set according to Table 7. Alternatively, the same information can be provided through ``USRX`` (columns 31-60) in block **INCON**. To write these element-by-element parameters to file *SAVE*, set ``MOP(13)`` = 1.

Repeat record **ELEME.1** for the number of elements desired.

    *   - ``ISOT``
        - I5
        - set equal to 1, 2, or 3; specifies absolute permeability to be ``PER(ISOT)`` for the materials in elements (``EL1``, ``NE1``) and (``EL2``, ``NE2``), where ``PER`` is read in block **ROCKS**. This allows assignment of different permeabilities, e.g., in the horizontal and vertical direction.

        - cosine of the angle between the gravitational acceleration vector and the line between the two elements. ``GF`` Ã— ``BETAX`` > 0 (<0) corresponds to first element being above (below) the second element.
    *   - ``SIGX``

              G_{rad} = SIGX \times \sigma_0 \times AREAX \times \left( T_2^4 - T_1^4 \right)

          | where :math:`\sigma_0` = 5.6687e-8 J/m\ :sup:`2` K\ :sup:`4` s is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and :math:`T_1` and :math:`T_1` are the absolute temperatures of the two grid blocks. ``SIGX`` may be entered as a negative number, in which case the absolute value will be used, and heat conduction at the connection will be suppressed. ``SIGX`` = 0 will result in no radiative heat transfer.

Repeat record **CONNE.1** for the number of connections desired.

A blank record closes the **CONNE** data block.
Alternatively, connection information may terminate on a record with ``+++`` typed in the first three columns, followed by element cross-referencing information.

          |  - WATE: water
          |  - COM1: component 1

          |  - MASS: mass production rate specified
          |  - DELV: well on deliverability, i.e., production occurs against specified bottomhole pressure. If well is completed in more than one layer, bottommost layer must be specified first, with number of layers given in ``LTAB``. Subsequent layers must be given sequentially for a total number of ``LTAB`` layers.
          |  - F--- or f---: well on deliverability against specified wellhead pressure. By convention, when the first letter of a type specification is F or f, TOUGH3 will perform flowing wellbore pressure corrections using tabular data of flowing bottomhole pressure vs. flow rate and flowing enthalpy. The tabular data used for flowing wellbore correction must be generated by means of a wellbore simulator ahead of a TOUGH3 run as ASCII data of 80 characters per record, according to the format specifications below.

             | The first record is an arbitrary title. The second record holds the number of flow rate and flowing enthalpy data (table points), ``NG`` and ``NH``, respectively, in format 2I5; in :numref:`table_6` we have ``NG`` = 11, ``NH`` = 9. This is followed by ``NG`` flow rate data in format 8E10.4, and ``NH`` enthalpy data also in format 8E10.4. After this come ``NG`` sets of ``NH`` flowing bottomhole pressure data in format 8E10.4. The data in :numref:`table_6` were generated with the HOLA wellbore simulator (Aunzo et al., 1991) for a 0.2 m (â‰ˆ8 inch) inside diameter well of 1,000 m feed zone depth with 7 bars wellhead pressure. Formation temperature for the conductive heat loss calculation in HOLA was assumed to increase linearly from 25ËšC at the land surface to 275.5ËšC at 750 m depth. Flow rates cover the range from 0.5 to 90.5 kg/s, and flowing enthalpies cover the range from 1,000 to 1,400 kJ/kg. A data record with very large bottomhole pressures of 55.55 MPa was added by hand for a very large hypothetical rate of 1,000 kg/s. This was done to avoid rates going out of table range during Newton-Raphson iteration in a TOUGH3 flow simulation.
             | The data must be provided by means of a disk file, whose name consists of the four characters of the ``TYPE`` specification, and the one character of the following ``ITAB`` parameter. For example, to use wellbore pressure data in a disk file called *f725d*, specify ``TYPE`` as *f725*, and specify ``ITAB`` as *d*. Different wellbore tables, representing, e.g., wells with different diameter, feed zone depth, and flowing wellhead pressure, may be used simultaneously in a TOUGH3 simulation. Also, several wells completed in different grid blocks may reference the same wellbore table.

        - constant generation rate; positive for injection, negative for production; ``GX`` is mass rate (kg/s) for generation types COM1, COM2, COM3, etc, and MASS; it is energy rate (J/s) for a HEAT sink/source. For wells on deliverability, ``GX`` is productivity index PI (m\ :sup:`3`), Eq. :math:numref:`eq:16`.
    *   - ``EX``
        - E10.4
        - fixed specific enthalpy (J/kg) of the fluid for mass injection (``GX`` > 0). For wells on deliverability against fixed bottomhole pressure, ``EX`` is bottomhole pressure :math:`P_{wb}` (Pa), at the center of the topmost producing layer in which the well is open.

    *   - ``F3(L)``

        - ``L`` = 1, ``LTAB`` generation rates.

Repeat records **GENER.1**, **GENER.1.1**, **GENER.1.2**, and **GENER.1.3** for the number of sinks/sources desired.

A blank record closes the **GENER** data block. 
Alternatively, generation information may terminate on a record with ``+++`` typed in the first three columns, followed by element cross-referencing information.

In addition to the standard input format, time-dependent generation rates (i.e., if ``LTAB`` > 1 in block **GENER.1**) can be provided as a free-format table with time in the first column, injection or production rate in the second column, and (if ``ITAB`` is not left blank) specific enthalpy in the third column.
The number of table rows is given by ``LTAB``.
The tabular format is chosen by providing the character "T" or "D" in Column 7 after keyword **GENER**.
Moreover, time and rate conversion factors can be given in columns 11-20 and 21-30.
If character "D" is specified in Column 7, time can be given in (any) date format; it will be converted to seconds (relative to the first date given).
These conversion factors only apply to sinks/source with time-dependent generation rates (i.e., constant rates given in columns 41-50 of block 
**GENER.1** are not affected).
The free-format options are only available if sinks/sources are given directly in the TOUGH3 input deck.
The external file *GENER* has to be provided in the standard format.

.. _geometry_data:

Geometry Data
-------------

General concepts
****************

Flow geometry in TOUGH3 is defined by means of a list of volume elements ("grid blocks") and a list of flow connections between them, as in other "integral finite difference" codes (:cite:label:`narasimhan1976integrated`).
This formulation can handle regular and irregular flow geometries in one, two, and three dimensions.
Single- and multiple-porosity systems (porous and fractured media) can be specified, and higher-order methods, such as seven- and nine-point differencing, can be implemented by means of appropriate specification of geometric data (:cite:label:`pruess1983seven`).

In TOUGH3, volume elements are identified by names that consist of a string of by default five characters, ``12345``, unless a different length of element names is specified in data block 
MOMOP (``MOP2(2)`` > 5).
These are arbitrary, except that the last two characters (#4 and 5) must be numbers if grids are generated using ``NSEQ`` in data block **ELEME** and **CONNE**; an example of a valid element name is "``ELE10``".
Flow connections are specified as ordered pairs of elements, such as "(``ELE10``, ``ELE11``)".
A variety of options and facilities are available for entering and processing geometric data (see :numref:`fig:8`).
Element volumes and domain identification can be provided by means of a data block **ELEME** in the input file, while a data block **CONNE** can be used to supply connection data, including interface area, nodal distances from the interface, and orientation of the nodal line relative to the vertical.
These data are internally written to a disk file *MESH*, which in turn initializes the geometry data arrays used during the flow simulation.
It is also possible to omit the **ELEME** and **CONNE** data blocks from the input file, and provide geometry data directly on a disk file *MESH*.

    User options for supplying geometry data.


Meshmaker
*********

TOUGH3 offers an additional way for defining flow system geometry by means of a special program module MESHMaker.
This can perform a number of mesh generation and processing operations and is invoked with the keyword **MESHM** in the input file (see :numref:`fig:9`).
The MESHMaker module has a modular structure.
At the present time, there are three sub-modules available in MESHMaker: keywords RZ2D or RZ2DL invoke generation of a one or two-dimensional radially symmetric R-Z mesh; XYZ initiates generation of a one, two, or three dimensional Cartesian X-Y-Z mesh; and MINC calls a modified version of the *GMINC* program (:cite:label:`pruess1983gminc`) to sub-partition a primary porous medium mesh into a secondary mesh for fractured media, using the method of "multiple interacting continua" (:cite:label:`pruess1985practical`), which will be described in detail below.

Several naming conventions for the elements created with keywords RZ2D (or RZ2DL) and XYZ have been adopted in the internal mesh generation process.
In addition to the traditional TOUGH2 conventions, the other conventions are adopted to accommodate large numbers of grid blocks in cases with ``MOP2(2)`` > 5 or ``MOP2(27)`` > 0.
Both RZ2D and XYZ assign all grid blocks to domain #1 (first entry in block **ROCKS**); a user desiring changes in domain assignments must do so by hand, either through editing of the *MESH* file with a text editor, or by means of preprocessing with an appropriate utility program, or by appropriate source code changes in subroutines *WRZ2D* and *GXYZ*.
TOUGH3 runs that involve RZ2D or XYZ mesh generation will produce a special printout, showing element names arranged in their actual geometric pattern.

The naming conventions for the MINC process are as follows.
For a primary grid block with name ``12345``, the corresponding fracture subelement in the secondary mesh is named ``12345`` (character #1 replaced with a blank for easy recognition).
The successive matrix continua are labeled by running character #1 through 2, ..., 9, A, B, ..., Z.
The domain assignment is incremented by 1 for the fracture grid blocks, and by 2 for the matrix grid blocks.
Thus, domain assignments in data block **ROCKS** should be provided in the following order: the first entry is the single (effective) porous medium, then follows the effective fracture continuum, and then the rock matrix.
Users should be aware that the MINC process may lead to ambiguous element names when the inactive element device is used to keep a portion of the primary mesh as unprocessed porous medium.
Also, the MINC process may generate duplicate element names. TOUGH3 will check the element names after reading disk file *MESH*, and abort the simulation if duplicate element names are found. 

.. figure:: ../figures/figure_9.png
    :name: fig:9
    :align: center
    :width: 75%

    MESHMaker input formats.

As a convenience for users desiring graphical display of data, the internal mesh generation process will also write nodal point coordinates on file MESH.
By default these data are written in 3E10.4 format into columns 51-80 of each grid block entry in data block **ELEME**, unless a longer effective digit of 3E20.14 format into columns 51-110 is specified in data block **MOMOP** (``MOP2(22)`` > 0).
No internal use is made of nodal point coordinates in TOUGH3, except for optional initialization of a gravity-capillary equilibrium with EOS9 (see the addendum for EOS9) and for optional addition of potential energy to enthalpy with ``MOP2(12)`` > 0 in data block **MOMOP**.

Mesh generation and/or MINC processing can be performed as part of a simulation run.
Alternatively, by closing the input file with the keyword **ENDFI** (instead of **ENDCY**), it is possible 
to skip the flow simulation and only execute the MESHMaker module to generate a *MESH* or *MINC* file.
These files can then be used, with additional user-modifications by hand if desired, in subsequent flow simulations.
Execution of MESHMaker produces printed output which is self-explanatory.


Multiple-porosity processing
****************************

Multiple-porosity processing for simulation of flow in naturally fractured reservoirs can be invoked by means of a keyword MINC, which stands for "multiple interacting continua" (:cite:label:`pruess1985practical`).
The MINC-process operates on the data of the primary (porous medium) mesh as provided on disk file *MESH*, and generates a "secondary" mesh containing fracture and matrix elements with identical data formats on file *MINC*.
By appropriate subgridding of the matrix blocks, as shown in :numref:`fig:10`, and therefore by resolving the driving pressure, temperature, and mass fraction gradients at the matrix and fracture interface, the transient, multiphase interporosity flows between rock matrix and fractures can accurately be described.
The MINC concept is based on the notion that changes in fluid pressures, temperatures, phase compositions, etc, due to the presence of sinks and sources (production and injection wells) will propagate rapidly through the fracture system, while invading the tight matrix blocks only slowly.
Therefore, changes in matrix conditions will (locally) be controlled by the distance from the fractures.
Fluid and heat flow from the fractures into the matrix blocks, or from the matrix blocks into the fractures, can then be modeled by means of one-dimensional strings of nested grid blocks, as shown in :numref:`fig:10`.
The MINC-method lumps all fractions within a certain reservoir subdomain into continuum #1, all matrix material within a certain distance from the fractures into continuum #2, matrix material at larger distance into continuum #3, and so on.
Quantitatively, the subgridding is specified by means of a set of volume fractions, into which the primary porous medium grid blocks are partitioned.
The MINC-process in the MESHMaker module operates on the element and connection data of a porous medium mesh to calculate, for given data on volume fractions, the volumes, interface areas, and nodal distances for a secondary fractured medium mesh.
The information on fracturing (spacing, number of sets, shape of matrix blocks) required for this is provided by a "proximity function" PROX(x) which expresses, for a given reservoir domain :math:`V_0`, the total fraction of matrix material within a distance :math:`x` from the fractures.
If only two continua are specified (one for fractures, one for matrix), the MINC approach reduces to the conventional double-porosity method (:cite:label:`warren1963behavior`).
Full details are given in a separate report (:cite:label:`pruess1983gminc`).
For any given fractured reservoir flow problem, selection of the most appropriate gridding scheme must be based on a careful consideration of the physical and geometric conditions of flow.
The MINC approach is not applicable to systems in which fracturing is so sparse that the fractures cannot be approximated as a continuum.

    :name: fig:10
    :align: center
    :width: 75%

    Subgridding in the method of "multiple interacting continua" (MINC).

The file *MESH* used in this process can be either directly supplied by the user, or it can have been internally generated either from data in input blocks **ELEME** and **CONNE**, or from RZ2D or XYZ mesh- making.
The MINC process of sub-partitioning porous medium grid blocks into fracture and matrix continua will only operate on active grid blocks, while inactive grid blocks are left unchanged as single porous medium blocks.
In TOUGH3, elements in data block **ELEME** (or file *MESH*) are taken to be "active" unless they have very large volumes, which are taken to be "inactive".
In order to exclude selected reservoir domains from the MINC process and make them remain single porous media, the user needs to change the volume of the corresponding blocks to a very large number before MINC partitioning is made.
Note that here the concept of inactive blocks is used in an unrelated manner with respect to the one to maintain time-independent Dirichlet boundary conditions (see Section :ref:`initial_and_boundary_conditions`).


.. _input_formats_for_meshmaker:

Input Formats for MESHMAKER
---------------------------

Generation of radially symmetric grid
*************************************

Keyword RZ2D (or RZ2DL) invokes generation of a radially symmetric mesh.
Nodal points will be placed half-way between neighboring radial interfaces.
When RZ2D is specified, the mesh will be generated by columns; i.e., in the **ELEME** block we will first have the grid blocks at 
smallest radius for all layers, then the next largest radius for all layers, and so on.
With keyword RZ2DL the mesh will be generated by layers; i.e., in the **ELEME** block we will first have all grid blocks for the first (top) layer from smallest to largest radius, then all grid blocks for the second layer, and so on.
Apart from the different ordering of elements, the two meshes for RZ2D and RZ2DL are identical.
The reason for providing the two alternatives is as a convenience to users in implementing boundary conditions by way of inactive elements (see Section :ref:`initial_and_boundary_conditions`).
RZ2D makes it easy to declare a vertical column inactive, facilitating assignment of boundary conditions in the vertical, such as a gravitationally equilibrated pressure gradient.
RZ2DL on the other hand facilitates implementation of areal (top and bottom layer) boundary conditions.


RADII
^^^^^

RADII is the first keyword following RZ2D; it introduces data for defining a set of interfaces (grid block boundaries) in the radial direction.

        - I5
        - number of desired radial increments.
    *   - 
        - 5X
        - (void)
    *   - ``DR``
        - E10.4
        - number of desired radial increments.

Note that at least one radius must have been defined via block RADII before EQUID can be invoked.


LOGAR
^^^^^

Introduces data on radial increments that increase from one to the next by the same factor (:math:`\Delta R_{n + 1} = f \cdot \Delta R_n`).

.. list-table:: Record **LOGAR.1**.
    :name: tab:logar.1
    :widths: 1 1 6
    :header-rows: 1
    :align: center

        - Description
    *   - ``NLOG``
        - I5
        - number of additional interface radii desired.
    *   - 
        - 5X
        - (void)
    *   - ``RLOG``
        - E10.4
        - desired radius of the last (largest) of these radii.
    *   - ``DR``
        - E10.4
        - reference radial increment: the first :math:`\Delta R` generated will be equal to f Ã— ``DR``, with f internally determined such that the last increment will bring total radius to ``RLOG``. f < 1 for decreasing radial increments is permissible. If ``DR`` is set equal to zero, or left blank, the last increment ``DR`` generated before keyword LOGAR will be used as default.

Additional blocks RADII, EQUID, and LOGAR can be specified in arbitrary order.
Note that at least one radius must have been defined before LOGAR can be invoked.
If ``DR`` = 0, at least two radii must have been defined.


LAYER

    :header-rows: 1
    :align: center

    *   - Parameter
        - Format
        - Description
    *   - ``H(I)``
        - E10.4
        - ``I`` = 1, ``NLAY`` layer thicknesses, from top layer downward. By default, zero or blank entries for layer thickness will result in assignment of the last preceding non-zero entry. Assignment of a zero layer thickness, as needed for inactive layers, can be accomplished by specifying a negative value.

The LAYER data close the RZ2D data block.
Note that one blank record must follow to indicate termination of the **MESHM** data block.
Alternatively, keyword MINC can appear to invoke MINC-processing for fractured media (see below).


Generation of rectilinear grids
*******************************

XYZ
^^^

Invokes generation of a Cartesian (rectilinear) mesh.

        - E10.4
        - angle (in degrees) between the Y-axis and the horizontal. If gravitational acceleration (parameter ``GF`` in record **PARAM.2**) is specified positive, -90Â° < ``DEG`` < 90Â° corresponds to grid layers going from top down. Grids can be specified from bottom layer up by setting ``GF`` or ``BETA`` negative. Default (``DEG`` = 0) corresponds to horizontal Y- and vertical Z-axis. X-axis is always horizontal.

.. list-table:: Record **XYZ.2**.
    :name: tab:xyz.2
    :widths: 1 1 6

    *   - ``DEL``
        - E10.4
        - constant grid increment for ``NO`` grid blocks, if set to a non-zero value.

.. list-table:: Record **XYZ.3**.
    :name: tab:xyz.3
    :widths: 1 1 6
    :header-rows: 1
    :align: center

    *   - Parameter
        - Format

        - E10.4
        - ``I`` = 1, ``NO`` grid increments in the direction specified by ``NTYPE`` in record XYZ.2. Additional records with formats as XYZ.2 and XYZ.3 can be provided, with X, Y, and Z-data in arbitrary order.

A blank record closes the XYZ data block.

Note that the end of block MESHMaker is also marked by a blank record.
Thus, when MESHMaker/XYZ is used, there will be two blank records at the end of the corresponding input data block.


MINC processing for fractured media
***********************************

MINC
^^^^
Invokes postprocessing of a primary porous medium mesh from file MESH.
The input formats in data block MINC are identical to those of the *GMINC* program (:cite:label:`pruess1983gminc`), with two enhancements: there is an additional facility for specifying global matrix-matrix connections ("dual permeability"); further, only active elements will be subjected to MINC-processing, the remainder of the MESH remaining unaltered as porous medium grid blocks.


PART
^^^^

PART is the first keyword following MINC; it will be followed on the same line by parameters ``TYPE`` and ``DUAL`` with information on the nature of fracture distributions and matrix-matrix connections.

.. list-table:: Record **PART.1**.

          | ONE-D: a set of plane parallel infinite fractures with matrix block thickness between neighboring fractures equal to ``PAR(1)``.
          | TWO-D: two sets of plane parallel infinite fractures, with arbitrary angle between them. Matrix block thickness is ``PAR(1)`` for the first set, and ``PAR(2)`` for the second set. If ``PAR(2)`` is not specified explicitly, it will be set equal to ``PAR(1)``.
          | THRED: three sets of plane parallel infinite fractures at right angles, with matrix block dimensions of ``PAR(1)``, ``PAR(2)``, and ``PAR(3)``, respectively. If ``PAR(2)`` and/or ``PAR(3)`` are not explicitly specified, they will be set equal to ``PAR(1)`` and/or ``PAR(2)``, respectively.
          | STANA: average proximity function for rock loading of Stanford large reservoir model (:cite:label:`lam1988analysis`).
          | STANB: proximity function for the five bottom layers of Stanford large reservoir model.
          | STANT: proximity function for top layer of Stanford large reservoir model.
          |
          | Note: a user wishing to employ a different proximity function than provided in MINC needs to replace the function subprogram PROX(x) in file *Mesh_Maker.f90* with a routine of the form:
        
          .. code-block:: fortran

             FUNCTION PROX(x)
             PROX = (arithmetic expression in x)
             RETURN
             END

          | It is necessary that PROX(x) is defined even when x exceeds the maximum possible distance from the fractures, and that PROX = 1 in this case. Also, when the user supplies his/her own proximity function subprogram, the parameter ``TYPE`` has to be chosen equal to ONE-D, TWO-D, or THRED, depending on the dimensionality of the proximity function. This will assure proper definition of innermost nodal distance (:cite:label:`pruess1983gminc`).

        - | a five-character word for selecting the treatment of global matrix matrix flow:
          | blank:  (default) global flow occurs only through the fracture continuum, while rock matrix and fractures interact locally by means of interporosity flow ("double-porosity" model).
          | MMVER: global matrix-matrix flow is permitted only in the vertical; otherwise like the double-porosity model; for internal consistency this choice should only be made for flow systems with one or two predominantly vertical fracture sets.
          | MMALL:  global matrix-matrix flow in all directions; for internal consistency only two continua, representing matrix and fractures, should be specified ("dual-permeability").
